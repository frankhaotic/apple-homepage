# Apple Homepage Clone

## Why the Apple Homepage?

Apple is one of the biggest companies in the world, and they are known for their aesthetic. Such a company would diligently make sure that the developers were accurately rendering the work of their web designers into code. I thought that replicating this would be a good standard to aim for.

## Technologies Used

Plain HTML with SCSS - Styled CSS, a variant of Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets.

## Further Development

At the moment the majority of the homepage design has been replicated. I intend to continue work on the project, adding javascript and css animation to the dropdown menus, searchbar etc.
